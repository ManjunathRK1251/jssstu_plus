                            The interviewers were very friendly. In my view, the
                            process followed by any company is a process of
                            selection, rather than elimination. The companies
                            require talented people. So don’t get tensed, no
                            pressure. Just get your basics right, learn to think
                            logically. Keep things simple.

                            Concepts like DS, Algorithms, OS and DBMS are
                            important and the concepts like CN, Java are
                            important for few companies. Coding skills and
                            problem solving are very important. So practice a
                            lot by solving more and more problems.

                            Your approach matters a lot. So think twice before
                            you decide to implement anything. You should always
                            calculate the time complexity and space complexity
                            that your method entails, and also think of test
                            cases for which your approach could fail. Also, ask
                            the interviewer a lot of questions and understand
                            what (s)he’s looking for. Listen to their cues and
                            use them in your implementation.
